                        <p id="intro" class="col-12 col-md-9 text-muted">Hello, My name is Jared. I am 25 years old and a husband and father of 2. I currently work as a Water Distribution Operator for my city’s water department. I have worked in the construction industry for over 5 years and have enjoyed the work I’ve done. Since childhood, it was an objective of mine to help people and serve in the military. In October of 2020, I enlisted in the Army as an infantryman. I loved being part of a team and something bigger than myself. Nowadays, I enjoy civilian life and spending time outdoors with my family. Since I have always found pleasure in learning new things, I decided to act on my curiosity towards tech. I quickly found a strong delight in my studies and knew that it was what I wanted to pursue. I am now on my journey to achieve my career goal of being a software engineer and can't wait for my dream to become a reality.

                        <p id="from" class="text-muted">I was born in Richmond, Texas in December of 1997. In 2001 my parents, 4 siblings, and I moved to Arkansas due to my father’s work. Since then, my family has stayed local and built our lives in this beautiful town. Although Texas will always be a place I love, Arkansas is what I call home. You may be wondering why I added a picture of a random, old grocery store in this section. The Walton’s 5-10 in the photo is the very first store that Sam Walton, the owner of the world-famous Walmart, opened in 1950. Bentonville is the home of Walmart and, for us residents, it is a part of life. Even you may have noticed the small town yourself if you have ever gone to one of Sam’s stores and decided to read the back of a product you bought to see where it was distributed from. To your surprise, you read a city you have never heard of in a state you didn’t know really existed. Our hometown is also known as the Mountain Biking Capital of the World and the new home of the U.S. National Mountain Bike team. There are a lot of other things that make this place great, but you will only believe it if you see it.
